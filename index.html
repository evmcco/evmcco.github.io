            About:
          </h2>
          <p>
            In April of 2019 I left my job as a Product Manager to study Full
            Stack Web Development at DigitalCrafts full-time. Previously I've
            also had roles in QA, Project Management, and Consulting. My main
            goal when learning how to build web apps is to one day build an app
            that I can start a business around. I feel the best when I'm able to
            build and implement some of the crazy ideas that I come up with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up in Atlanta, and graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree
            in Industrial Engineering. Music is my first love - I’ve been
            playing the Saxophone for 15 years and was a DJ in college. I also
            have two dogs, Pepper and Tucker, who keep me sane and
            well-exercised. Lastly I love to travel overseas, with some of my
            favorite trips being Scotland, South Korea, and Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're curious about my subtitle - going to space is at the top
            of my bucket list. I've always been fascinated by the cosmos, and I
            hope by the time that space tourism is within my budget I am healthy
            enough to make it up there.

          <p>
            Heatseeker is a project I built to solve a problem that I, as a
            thrifty sneakerhead, had - getting exclusive sneaker releases at
            retail price. When a new release happens, aspiring purchasers have 3
            options: try to beat out the bots for the shoes online, pay a
            premium on the secondary market, or go down to their local sneaker
            store and enter a raffle. Your odds of winning a local raffle are
            much higher than online, but these local raffles can be hard to
            track down. Boutiques only post about them online, and they only
            last about 24 hours before the raffle is over. Heatseeker scans
            Instagram, looking for sneaker boutiques posting about their
            raffles, and centralizes all of these posts, allowing users to
            filter on them geographically so they can know which stores near
            them are holding raffles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heatseeker V2 is a React app, built on top of an Express API server,
            with a PostgreSQL database hosted via Amazon RDS. ToI built a node
            script that scrapes a collection of instagram accounts to find all
            of their recent posts, and picks out the recent posts that are
            related to raffles. I then built a manual validation form to grab
            some key data from each post or reject posts in case of false
            positives. The React front end displays all sneaker raffles posts
            from stores all over the country, and users can submit their
            location to filter the list down to stores within 100 miles. If
            there are no raffles going on, users can view old raffles to get a
            preview of what info Heatseeker has.

            The DigitalCrafts Project Database is a full-stack project for
            DigitalCrafts built with Node, Express, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS,
            Javascript, and ES6 Renderer. It was built with a team of 3 over the
            course of 3 days in class. We built the DCPD to be a solution to a
            problem that many bootcamp students have: finding inspiration (or
            help) when building projects. Any DigitalCrafts student or alumni
            can submit a project to the database (via Slack authentication), and
            the database is viewable to everyone.

            To Mom, Love Evan is an interactive card I made for my mom for
            Mother's Day '19. My mom is nortoriously hard to shop for so I got
            her something no one else could, a website! I also took this as an
            opportunity to learn Three.js, a javascript library for 3d image
            rendering, built on WebGL.

            Astrologic is a front-end project for DigitalCrafts, built by a team
            of 3 over 3 days of class. Inspired by fantasy sports, we wanted a
            way to find an edge when competing with our friends, so we decided
            to use information that no one else was to perfect our lineups -
            horoscopes. The page is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and
            utilzies 2 APIs: the Wikipedia API to return player informationa and
            photos, and an Astrology API to return horoscope data.
